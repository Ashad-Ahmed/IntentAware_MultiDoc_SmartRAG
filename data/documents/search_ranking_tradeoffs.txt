Modern information retrieval systems must resolve inherent tensions between precision, recall, 
latency, and computational cost. Precision prioritizes relevance purity, whereas recall seeks 
completeness. Excessive focus on one metric typically degrades the other, forcing tradeoffs.

Lexical retrieval models operate on token statistics. Algorithms such as BM25 estimate relevance 
based on term frequency, inverse document frequency, and document length normalization. These 
methods remain highly effective for keyword-oriented queries, structured identifiers, and 
domain-specific vocabulary.

However, lexical matching struggles with paraphrasing. Semantically equivalent phrases lacking 
shared tokens may receive low scores despite high conceptual similarity. This limitation motivated 
the adoption of dense retrieval methods based on learned embeddings.

Dense retrieval encodes text into high-dimensional vectors capturing semantic relationships. 
Similarity comparisons via cosine distance or inner product allow retrieval based on meaning 
rather than exact wording. While embeddings improve robustness to phrasing variation, they 
introduce distinct failure modes.

Rare tokens, numeric values, product codes, and technical identifiers often produce unreliable 
embedding behavior. Vector similarity may prioritize conceptual proximity while ignoring critical 
lexical constraints. Consequently, vector-only retrieval may omit exact-match results essential 
for certain queries.

Hybrid retrieval strategies combine lexical and semantic signals. Rank fusion techniques aggregate 
candidate lists from multiple retrieval models, leveraging complementary strengths. Reciprocal Rank 
Fusion is particularly popular due to its stability and independence from score calibration.

Reranking layers further refine candidate ordering. Cross-encoder architectures jointly encode 
queries and passages, modeling fine-grained interactions. Although computationally expensive, 
rerankers significantly improve relevance precision.

Ranking pipelines must also consider redundancy effects. Highly similar passages may dominate top 
positions, reducing informational diversity. Deduplication and diversity heuristics mitigate 
context repetition and improve answer completeness.

System designers additionally account for latency budgets. Dense retrieval and reranking operations 
carry inference costs that scale with candidate pool size. Efficient pipelines balance recall with 
computational feasibility.

Evaluation of ranking systems requires rigorous measurement. Precision@K, Recall@K, normalized 
discounted cumulative gain, and mean reciprocal rank are commonly used metrics. Offline evaluation 
datasets approximate production behavior but rarely capture full query diversity.

Ultimately, ranking quality depends not only on retrieval models but also on query interpretation, 
corpus characteristics, user intent, and domain semantics.
